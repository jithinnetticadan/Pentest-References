Enable disabled buttons using reverse engineering techniques to access/perform unauthorized operations.

Information Gathering
	functioanlity
	architecture
	File accessed by client
	network communications
	Tools used : CFF Explorer (ntcore.com), Sysinternal Suite (TCPView, procmon etc..), Wireshark
	tcpview can be used to view the ip address of remotes server the app is communicating
	cff exploreer to understand how the binary is built

Traffic Analysis
	intercept http traffic using burpsuite
	intercept non-http traffic using echo mirage/ MITM-Relay+Burp (requires python installed download get-pip module to install lib using pip, pip install requests)

Insecure Data Storage
	hardcoded secrets -strings.exe (inside sysinternals suite), regshot
	dnspy - reverse engineer and search for interesting strings
	regisytryeditor in-built - use for privesc

Dumping connection string from memory
	db connection strings, internal server connections, protoco connection
	in some scenarios even though the string is encrypted it mught be decrypted and stored in the memory which can be dumped

Side Channel Leaks
	application logs, debug logs in console
	using command prompt run the the exe
	cmd = app.exe > C:\userd\desktop\logs.txt
	detect excessive logging issues

Unreliable Data
	timestamp manipulation TO make the logs unreliable for incident response
	client side details collected for forensic purposes cannot be trusted without validation

DLL Hijacking
	It is a library that contains executable code used by apps to perform some tasks
	DLL Load Order
		directory application is loaded
		current directory
		system directory c:\\windows\\system32
		16 bit system directory
		windows directory
		Directories listed in PATH variables
	can be used to elevate our privileges if app are running in admin mode
	procmon tool used
	malicious dll file generated using msfvenom
