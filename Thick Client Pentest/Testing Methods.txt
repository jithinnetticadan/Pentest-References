Enable disabled buttons using reverse engineering techniques to access/perform unauthorized operations.

Information Gathering
	functioanlity
	architecture
	File accessed by client
	network communications
	Tools used : CFF Explorer (ntcore.com), Sysinternal Suite (TCPView, procmon etc..), Wireshark
	tcpview can be used to view the ip address of remotes server the app is communicating
	cff exploreer to understand how the binary is built

Traffic Analysis
	intercept http traffic using burpsuite
	intercept non-http traffic using echo mirage/ MITM-Relay+Burp (requires python installed download get-pip module to install lib using pip, pip install requests)

GUI Modification 

	winspy - used to view the masked password fields in forms. (remember me option) Simply target a control and note that the masked value is stored in plain text.
	Windows Detective - Selecting a control will highlight the object in the desktop window hierarchy. There, you can view its properties, including the elusive password.
	Snoop - for a debugger).
You can change property values, view triggers, set breakpoints on property changes and many more things. (Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF))
 
Insecure Data Storage
	hardcoded secrets -strings.exe (inside sysinternals suite), regshot
	dnspy - reverse engineer and search for interesting strings
	regisytryeditor in-built - use for privesc
	ilspy
	dotpeek
	regshot - take 1st before app launch & 2nd shot after lanch (use plain.text or html)
	winspy - used to view the masked password fields in forms. (remember me option) Simply target a control and note that the masked value is stored in plain text.
	Windows Detective - Selecting a control will highlight the object in the desktop window hierarchy. There, you can view its properties, including the elusive password.

Dumping connection string from memory
	dnspy, processhacker, hardcoded
	db connection strings, internal server connections, protoco connection
	in some scenarios even though the string is encrypted it mught be decrypted and stored in the memory which can be dumped

Side Channel Leaks
	application logs, debug logs in console
	using command prompt run the the exe
	cmd = app.exe > C:\userd\desktop\logs.logs or logs.txt
	detect excessive logging issues

Unreliable Data
	timestamp manipulation to make the logs unreliable for incident response
	client side details collected for forensic purposes cannot be trusted without validation

DLL Hijacking
	It is a library that contains executable code used by apps to perform some tasks
	DLL Load Order
		directory application is loaded
		current directory
		system directory c:\\windows\\system32
		16 bit system directory
		windows directory
		Directories listed in PATH variables
	can be used to elevate our privileges if app are running in admin mode
	procmon tool used
	malicious dll file generated using msfvenom

Reverse Engineering

	dnspy - runtime-tracing (variables assigned values can be viewed) - also be used to change code functionality and recompile
	dotpeek - decompile
	ilspy & reflexil - decompile & edit assembly code and save as new exe file (copy the dll file in reflexil to ilspy folder and launch) - view button -> reflexil (to view the assembly code and modify)
	ilasm - assembler
	idasm - disassembler
	jd-gui - java decompiler

Low Hanging Fruits
	sigcheck - check whther binary is signed or not (part of sysinternals suite)
	binscoper - to check app is compiled using appropriate security
